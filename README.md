## Where am I?

Have you ever wondered how to know how **fast** your c++ code is ...

- ... using only **std** functions ...
- ... in a **single header** file ...
- ... with **no** namespace occlusion ...
- ... and 100% **OpenSource**?

**_Wait no more!_**

Because you have just landed on the _I-answer-all-your-questions_ repository of Chrono,
 a simple and plain c++ class that will cover all your needs. _And more!_
 
## How do I use it?

_No additional builds, no compilation issues, no added complexities!_

Simply do the following:

1. Make sure you are compiling your project using **gcc/g++ 6.0** or later.
1. Add `#include "Chrono.h` to the project file/s where you want to use Chrono.
1. Instantiate a Chrono object `Chrono chrono();`.
1. Start using our public methods!

## But I need more!

You still need more from Chrono?

_Then ask for it!_ **_That's why we are here!_**

- Simply open up an **issue** ...
- ... or fork our code and start a new **pull request**!
